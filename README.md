# math-notes
I'm going to write some math notes on here (often with the assistance of large language models)

Thanks to:
- The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator
- The [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for the theme
- The [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library for rendering math
- The [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library for rendering math
- Misha Brukman for the [tutorial](https://misha.brukman.net/blog/2022/04/writing-math-with-hugo/) on rendering math in PaperMod
